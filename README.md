Interplanetary Harvester

Resources are dwindling, and it's up to the Interplanetary Harvester company to recycle old and dying planets into newer, better ones.

The harvester takes a tremendous amount of energy when harvesting, so be careful not to harvest too many planets low in resources or you'll run out of energy to harvest more.

When placing a planet in preparation for harvesting, you can combine the resources of one planet with another. Water tiles upgrade Magma, Rock, and Earth tiles one step (From Magma to Rock, Rock to Earth, and Earth to Foliage). Magma will always trump any non-Water tile it is combined with. Also, be careful not to flood Foliage tiles with more Water.

When you're ready to create a new planet out of old ones, hover the cursor over a planet-shaped area of tiles and click to harvest. The total value of the harvest will be added to your score, minus the cost of harvesting.
